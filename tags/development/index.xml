&lt;p>It all started with a simple task - building my academic website. As a Ph.D. student at Harvard focusing on AI and healthcare, I&amp;rsquo;ve used various AI tools before, but nothing prepared me for what I was about to experience with Cline. What began as a straightforward development project turned into a fascinating journey that completely transformed my workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The moment of realization came when Cline not only understood my website requirements but directly started creating files, implementing features, and executing commands - all while maintaining perfect context awareness. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t just another AI chatbot; this was a true development partner that could interact with my system in ways I&amp;rsquo;d never seen before.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
